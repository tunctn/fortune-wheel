## What is this?
I needed a good looking fortune wheel app for a video that I was working on and the available fortune wheels on the internet were super ugly, so I decided to create one real quick. You can check the live project [here](https://fortunewheel.wust.co). 
Keep in mind that it's super simple and might contain bugs, bad behavior on mobile, etc. You are welcome to send PRs.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
